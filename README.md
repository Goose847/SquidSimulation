# SquidSimulation

This repository houses the Jupyter Notebook and PDF write up that I worked on in 2021 as a part of my Third Year Applied Maths course.
The purpose of the project was to construct a simulation of squid populations in order to test a 'catching function' that would allow us to extract the resourse with the goal of maximising yield while minimising risk to the population.
